  <li><h4>About</h4>
    <p>
    The Rivendell Councilroom is a deck builder for the Lord of the Rings
    LCG by Fantasy Flight Games. It was built from scratch using AngularJS.
    Please refer to the <b><a href="https://github.com/ddddirk/lotrdb">project page</a></b>
    for more information on the development of the Rivendell Councilroom.
    </p>

  <li><h4>How to use</h4>
    <p>
      The Rivendell Councilroom is designed to be a simple and intuitive, 
      yet fully featured deck builder. The left portion of the screen
      shows the cards currently in your deck, the center portion shows a card
      preview, the right portion shows the cards and some settings.<br/>
      There is no login and no information is saved on the server. Please make
      your own backups of decks, as nothing can be recovered in case of
      loss of information.
    </p>
    <li style="list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: url('img/spheres/1leadership.png');">
    <b>Cards</b>
    <p>
      In the Cards tab, you can browse cards to add to your deck.
      This tab also gives you the ability to search for cards by name (be
      sure not to use accents, type 'Gloin' to find Glóin, for instance),
      card trait, card text, card type and card sphere.<br/>
      You can also sort the cards by name, sphere, cost, willpower, attack,
      defense or hitpoints, by clicking on the relevant headers.
    </p>
    <li style="list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: url('img/spheres/2tactics.png');">
    <b>Packs</b>
    <p>
      In the Packs tab, you can select which packs you own. Only cards from
      these packs will show up in the Cards tab. The packs you've selected
      are stored in your browser data and will be remembered for subsequent
      visits to the deckbuilder.
    </p>
    <li style="list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: url('img/spheres/3spirit.png');">
    <b>Decks</b>
    <p>
      In the Decks tab, you can save the deck you've made (or are still working
      on) and load decks you've made in the past. Beware that clearing, loading
      or uploading decks will <b>overwrite your current deck without prompt</b>,
      so save your deck before loading another deck, or it will be lost.<br/>
      Saved decks can be downloaded, either in a text file that contains markup
      for both Reddit (MarkDown) and BoardGameGeek (BBCode) or as an OCTGN deck.
      Both these formats can also be uploaded. Note that uploading <b>Does not
      automatically save the deck</b>, it only loads it as the current deck.<br/>
      Decks are saved to and loaded from your local browser storage, so if you
      open the deck builder on another machine (or another web browser), your
      decks will not be present. Instead, you can either download the deck on the
      machine you saved it on and upload it elsewhere, or copy the link that appears
      in your browser's location bar as you save or load a deck. These links can
      also be used to share decks.
    </p>
    <li style="list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: url('img/spheres/4lore.png');">
    <b>Stats</b>
    <p>
      In the Stats tab, you can inspect the deck you've made. The left portion of the
      tab shows you sample starting hands, press 'Start' to draw six cards and
      'Draw' to draw additional cards. This should give you an impression of
      what a first turn would look like and what kind of opening strategies suit
      a deck. Be sure to press 'Start' after every change to the deck, as it is
      not updated automatically.<br/>
      On the right portion of the tab, several graphics are shown after you
      press the 'Reset' button. The top graph shows the costs cards in the deck,
      the middle graph shows the division of spheres in the deck and the bottom
      graphs shows the division of card types in the deck. Clicking on either a
      sphere or a card type will update to other two graphs, to reflect only the
      cards from that particular sphere or type. Again, after any change to the
      deck, or after loading a new deck, press 'Reset' to update the graphs.
